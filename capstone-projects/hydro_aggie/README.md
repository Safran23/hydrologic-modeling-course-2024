# Assessing ATS Model Performance for the Logan River (Franklin Basin): A Comparison with Observational Data (2022–2023)

## Summary
The main objectives of this work are: (1) to simulate key hydrologic variables using ATS; (2) to evaluate the model’s accuracy through comparison with high-quality field observations; and (3) to assess model performance under extreme runoff conditions taking motivation from work.

## Methods
- USing ATS

- Study Area
Franklin Basin in the Logan river

## Repository Structure
```
|-- data
|-- model
|   |-- inputs
|   `-- outputs
|-- scripts
`-- results
|   |-- figures
```
- `data`: provides data needed to run the model (e.g., meshes, meterological forcing, observation, etc.)
- `model`: provides input files and essential model outputs (e.g., observation points, mass balance)
- `scripts`: provides the scripts or jupyter notebooks for pre- and post- processing model files
- `results`: provides any results generated from the model analysis (e.g., figures associated with report)
