# Effects of canal seepage on subsurface flow and thermal processes in a canal-aquifer-river system through field observations and numerical modeling




## Summary
Current literature lacks numerical modeling of subsurface flow and temperature dynamics within canal-shallow aquifer-river systems. This project focuses on two research questions: how does canal seepage affect the subsurface flow and thermal processes in a canal-shallow aquifer-river system, and how does removing the canal seepage inputs from the system affect these processes? Specifically, this project will focus on creating 2D numerical model to use in answering how removing canal seepage inputs affects the system. The site to be modeled is near the mouth of Blacksmith Fork Canyon, UT, between Hyrum and Nibley Blacksmith Fork canals and the Blacksmith Fork River. 

## Methods
- Modeling tool
PFLOTRAN Thermal-Hydrologic

- Study Area
The site to be modeled is near the mouth of Blacksmith Fork canyon, between Hyrum and Nibley Blacksmith Fork canals (HBSFC, NBSFC) and the Blacksmith Fork River (BSFR).

- `data`: provides data needed to run the model (e.g., meshes, meterological forcing, observation, etc.)
- `model`: provides input files and essential model outputs (e.g., observation points, mass balance)
- `scripts`: provides the scripts or jupyter notebooks for pre- and post- processing model files
- `results`: provides any results generated from the model analysis (e.g., figures associated with report)
