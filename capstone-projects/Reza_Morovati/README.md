## Project Summary

This project focuses on assessing soil moisture variability and hydrologic response in the Logan River watershed using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator(ATS). Soil moisture is a critical component of watershed hydrology, influencing groundwater recharge, runoff generation, and ecosystem health. This study will use physics-based simulations with ATS to model variably saturated flow and surface-subsurface interactions, incorporating meteorological forcing data, soil properties, and land cover information. The analysis will focus on the area around USGS stream gauge 10109000 and simulate soil moisture profiles at multiple depths to evaluate responses to precipitation and evapotranspiration. The expected outcomes include improved understanding of soil moisture dynamics under real-world conditions and insights into the impacts of land use on soil retention. This project will contribute to enhanced watershed management strategies, drought forecasting, and regional hydrologic modeling approaches.
