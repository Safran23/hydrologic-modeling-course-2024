# Understanding Precipitation Partitioning and Hydrologic Impacts in Mountainous Catchments
This repository contains data and scripts necessary for reproducing the xx model.

## Summary
In the mountainous western United States, snowmelt is the primary source of downstream water supply, but a warming climate threatens the timing and quantity of future water resources. 
As precipitation shifts from snow to rain, the hydrologic impacts on streamflow and groundwater recharge remain poorly understood. 
This project aims to investigate how precipitation partitioning affects hydrological processes in mountainous catchments under changing climate conditions. 
Specifically, it will assess the impact of this shift on streamflow timing and quantity, as well as groundwater recharge, using ATS modeling for integrated hydrology and land surface interactions. 
The study will focus on the Mill Creek watershed within the Jordan River basin, leveraging historical climate and hydrologic data from USGS and NOAA, 
and testing hypothetical climate scenarios to predict future precipitation patterns. 
Expected outcomes include an improved understanding of how changing precipitation affects hydrologic partitioning, 
contributing to predictive models for the Great Salt Lake basin and supporting sustainable water management strategies for stakeholders in the region.
